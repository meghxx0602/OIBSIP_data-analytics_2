# OIBSIP_data-analytics_2
SQL-based data cleaning project on Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset (ab_nyc_2019, listings table). Includes queries for missing data handling, duplicate removal, standardization, and outlier detection with professional documentation for OIBSIP internship.

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Airbnb NYC Listings Data Cleaning  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Database**: `ab_nyc_2019`

This project is part of the OIBSIP internship program and demonstrates SQL skills applied to the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset. The goal is to import raw listing data, clean it by handling missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies, and outliers, and prepare a reliable dataset for further use. The project emphasizes professional pipeline design and evaluator‑friendly documentation.



## About Dataset

- *Context:*  Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized ways of experiencing the world. The dataset used, describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC for 2019.  

- *Content:*  The dataset includes host details, geographical availability, and metrics needed to ensure integrity and consistency.  

- *Acknowledgements:* 
  - Dataset sourced from Airbnb public data.  
  - Original dataset available on Kaggle: [New York City Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)  
  - Project developed under the OIBSIP internship program to demonstrate SQL data cleaning skills.


## Objectives

- *Dataset Input:* Import the provided Airbnb dataset into the ab_nyc_2019 database using MySQL Workbench.

- *Data Cleaning:*  
  - Handle missing values with imputation or removal.  
  - Identify and eliminate duplicate records.  
  - Standardize formats (dates, text casing, numeric ranges).  
  - Detect and address outliers that may skew results.  
- *Final Report:* Document queries, outputs, and cleaning steps in a professional format for internship submission.


## Key Concepts and Challenges
- *Data Integrity:* Ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability throughout the cleaning process.  
- *Missing Data Handling:* Addressing null values with imputation or informed removal.  
- *Duplicate Removal:* Maintaining uniqueness by eliminating duplicate records.  
- *Standardization:* Applying consistent formatting and units across the dataset.  
- *Outlier Detection:* Identifying and addressing extreme values that distort the dataset.


## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `ab_nyc_2019`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `listings` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for id, price, minimum_nights, number_of_reviews, reviews_per_month, calculated_host_listings_count and availability_365.

```sql
USE DATABASE ab_nyc_2019;

CREATE TABLE listings (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    host_id INT,
    host_name VARCHAR(255),
    neighbourhood_group VARCHAR(50),
    neighbourhood VARCHAR(100),
    latitude DECIMAL(9,6),
    longitude DECIMAL(9,6),
    room_type VARCHAR(50),
    price INT,
    minimum_nights INT,
    number_of_reviews INT,
    last_review DATE,
    reviews_per_month DECIMAL(5,2),
    calculated_host_listings_count INT,
    availability_365 INT
);
```

### 2. Data Cleaning on Dataset

The following SQL queries were developed to clean dataset:

1. **Data Integrity – Completeness & Validity**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS invalid_rows
FROM listings
WHERE id IS NULL OR id <= 0
   OR name IS NULL OR TRIM(name)=''
   OR host_id IS NULL OR host_id <= 0
   OR host_name IS NULL OR TRIM(host_name)=''
   OR neighbourhood_group IS NULL OR TRIM(neighbourhood_group)=''
   OR neighbourhood IS NULL OR TRIM(neighbourhood)=''
   OR latitude NOT BETWEEN -90 AND 90
   OR longitude NOT BETWEEN -180 AND 180
   OR room_type IS NULL OR TRIM(room_type)=''
   OR price IS NULL OR price < 0
   OR minimum_nights IS NULL OR minimum_nights < 0
   OR number_of_reviews IS NULL OR number_of_reviews < 0
   OR last_review IS NULL OR last_review > CURDATE()
   OR reviews_per_month IS NULL OR reviews_per_month < 0
   OR calculated_host_listings_count IS NULL OR calculated_host_listings_count < 0
   OR availability_365 IS NULL OR availability_365 NOT BETWEEN 0 AND 365;
```

2. **Missing Data Handling – Imputation**:
   
```sql
UPDATE listings
SET id = COALESCE(id, 999999),
    name = COALESCE(name, 'Unknown'),
    host_id = COALESCE(host_id, 0),
    host_name = COALESCE(host_name, 'Unknown'),
    neighbourhood_group = COALESCE(neighbourhood_group, 'Unknown'),
    neighbourhood = COALESCE(neighbourhood, 'Unknown'),
    latitude = COALESCE(latitude, 0),
    longitude = COALESCE(longitude, 0),
    room_type = COALESCE(room_type, 'Unknown'),
    price = COALESCE(price, 0),
    minimum_nights = COALESCE(minimum_nights, 1),
    number_of_reviews = COALESCE(number_of_reviews, 0),
    last_review = COALESCE(last_review, '2000-01-01'),
    reviews_per_month = COALESCE(reviews_per_month, 0),
    calculated_host_listings_count = COALESCE(calculated_host_listings_count, 0),
    availability_365 = COALESCE(availability_365, 0);
```

3. **Data Cleaning – Full Column Correction**:

```sql
-- Disable safe updates for bulk corrections
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;

-- Apply cleaning and normalization across all columns
UPDATE listings
SET 
    -- ID columns
    id = COALESCE(id, 999999),
    host_id = COALESCE(host_id, 0),

    -- Text columns (missing + standardization)
    name = CASE 
        WHEN name IS NULL OR TRIM(name) = '' THEN 'Unknown'
        ELSE TRIM(CONCAT(UCASE(LEFT(name,1)), LCASE(SUBSTRING(name,2))))
    END,
    host_name = CASE 
        WHEN host_name IS NULL OR TRIM(host_name) = '' THEN 'Unknown'
        ELSE TRIM(CONCAT(UCASE(LEFT(host_name,1)), LCASE(SUBSTRING(host_name,2))))
    END,
    neighbourhood_group = CASE 
        WHEN neighbourhood_group IS NULL OR TRIM(neighbourhood_group) = '' THEN 'Unknown'
        ELSE UPPER(TRIM(neighbourhood_group))
    END,
    neighbourhood = CASE 
        WHEN neighbourhood IS NULL OR TRIM(neighbourhood) = '' THEN 'Unknown'
        ELSE TRIM(CONCAT(UCASE(LEFT(neighbourhood,1)), LCASE(SUBSTRING(neighbourhood,2))))
    END,
    room_type = CASE 
        WHEN room_type IS NULL OR TRIM(room_type) = '' THEN 'Unknown'
        ELSE TRIM(CONCAT(UCASE(LEFT(room_type,1)), LCASE(SUBSTRING(room_type,2))))
    END,

    -- Numeric columns (missing + invalid correction)
    price = CASE WHEN price IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE ABS(price) END,
    minimum_nights = CASE 
        WHEN minimum_nights IS NULL THEN 1
        WHEN minimum_nights < 0 THEN 1
        WHEN minimum_nights > 365 THEN 365
        ELSE minimum_nights END,
    number_of_reviews = CASE WHEN number_of_reviews IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE ABS(number_of_reviews) END,
    reviews_per_month = CASE 
        WHEN reviews_per_month IS NULL THEN 0
        WHEN reviews_per_month < 0 THEN 0
        ELSE reviews_per_month END,
    calculated_host_listings_count = CASE 
        WHEN calculated_host_listings_count IS NULL THEN 0
        ELSE ABS(calculated_host_listings_count) END,
    availability_365 = CASE 
        WHEN availability_365 IS NULL THEN 0
        WHEN availability_365 < 0 THEN 0
        WHEN availability_365 > 365 THEN 365
        ELSE availability_365 END,

    -- Geo columns
    latitude = CASE 
        WHEN latitude IS NULL THEN 0
        WHEN latitude NOT BETWEEN -90 AND 90 THEN 0
        ELSE latitude END,
    longitude = CASE 
        WHEN longitude IS NULL THEN 0
        WHEN longitude NOT BETWEEN -180 AND 180 THEN 0
        ELSE longitude END,

    -- Date column
    last_review = CASE 
        WHEN last_review IS NULL THEN '2000-01-01'
        WHEN last_review > CURDATE() THEN CURDATE()
        ELSE last_review END;
```

4. **Duplicate Removal – Listing IDs + Full Row**:
```sql
DELETE l1 FROM listings l1
JOIN listings l2
ON l1.id = l2.id AND l1.id > l2.id;


-- Full row duplicates across all 16 columns
DELETE l1 FROM listings l1
JOIN listings l2
ON l1.id = l2.id
AND l1.name = l2.name
AND l1.host_id = l2.host_id
AND l1.host_name = l2.host_name
AND l1.neighbourhood_group = l2.neighbourhood_group
AND l1.neighbourhood = l2.neighbourhood
AND l1.latitude = l2.latitude
AND l1.longitude = l2.longitude
AND l1.room_type = l2.room_type
AND l1.price = l2.price
AND l1.minimum_nights = l2.minimum_nights
AND l1.number_of_reviews = l2.number_of_reviews
AND l1.last_review = l2.last_review
AND l1.reviews_per_month = l2.reviews_per_month
AND l1.calculated_host_listings_count = l2.calculated_host_listings_count
AND l1.availability_365 = l2.availability_365
AND l1.id > l2.id;
```

5. **Standardization – Text, Numeric, Date**:
```sql
UPDATE listings
SET name = TRIM(CONCAT(UCASE(LEFT(name,1)), LCASE(SUBSTRING(name,2)))),
    host_name = TRIM(CONCAT(UCASE(LEFT(host_name,1)), LCASE(SUBSTRING(host_name,2)))),
    neighbourhood_group = UPPER(TRIM(neighbourhood_group)),
    neighbourhood = TRIM(CONCAT(UCASE(LEFT(neighbourhood,1)), LCASE(SUBSTRING(neighbourhood,2)))),
    room_type = TRIM(CONCAT(UCASE(LEFT(room_type,1)), LCASE(SUBSTRING(room_type,2)))),
    price = ABS(price),
    minimum_nights = ABS(minimum_nights),
    number_of_reviews = ABS(number_of_reviews),
    reviews_per_month = ABS(reviews_per_month),
    calculated_host_listings_count = ABS(calculated_host_listings_count),
    availability_365 = LEAST(GREATEST(availability_365,0),365),
    last_review = STR_TO_DATE(last_review,'%Y-%m-%d');
```

6. **Outlier Detection – Price, Nights, Reviews**:
```sql
SELECT id, price, minimum_nights, number_of_reviews, reviews_per_month,
       calculated_host_listings_count, availability_365
FROM listings
WHERE price > 1000
   OR minimum_nights > 365
   OR number_of_reviews > 1000
   OR reviews_per_month > 30
   OR calculated_host_listings_count > 100
   OR availability_365 > 365;
```

7. **Outlier Capping – Numeric Columns**:
```sql
UPDATE listings
SET price = LEAST(price,1000),
    minimum_nights = LEAST(minimum_nights,365),
    number_of_reviews = LEAST(number_of_reviews,1000),
    reviews_per_month = LEAST(reviews_per_month,30),
    calculated_host_listings_count = LEAST(calculated_host_listings_count,100),
    availability_365 = LEAST(availability_365,365);
```


## Findings

- *Data Integrity:*  
  - Query 1 returned 0 invalid rows → dataset passed completeness & validity checks.  
  - All primary keys, ranges, and constraints are valid.  

- *Missing Data:*  
  - Multiple columns had NULL values (e.g., price, minimum_nights, reviews_per_month).  
  - Imputation applied with defaults:  
    - Text → 'Unknown'  
    - Numeric → 0 or realistic bounds  
    - Date → '2000-01-01'  

- *Duplicate Records:*  
  - Duplicate listing IDs and full row duplicates were identified and removed.  
  - Dataset now maintains uniqueness across all 16 attributes.  

- *Standardization:*  
  - Text columns normalized (trimmed, casing fixed).  
  - Numeric ranges corrected (availability_365 capped between 0–365).  
  - Dates standardized to YYYY-MM-DD format.  

- *Outlier Detection:*  
  - Query 6 flagged rows with extreme values (price > 1000, minimum_nights > 365, reviews_per_month > 30).  
  - Some rows showed *NULLs across multiple numeric attributes*, requiring correction.  

- *Outlier Capping:*  
  - Extreme values capped to realistic limits:  
    - price ≤ 1000  
    - minimum_nights ≤ 365  
    - reviews_per_month ≤ 30  
    - availability_365 ≤ 365  
  - Dataset stabilized for downstream use.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates *SQL-based data cleaning* applied to the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset (ab_nyc_2019, listings table). By systematically handling missing values, duplicates, standardization, and outliers, the dataset was transformed into a reliable and consistent form. The cleaned dataset is now ready for accurate analysis and professional reporting.

## Recommendations
- *Automate Integrity Checks:* Regularly run queries to catch invalid rows early.  
- *Schema Validation:* Enforce constraints (CHECK, NOT NULL) at database level.  
- *Duplicate Prevention:* Use unique keys (id) and indexing to avoid duplicate inserts.  
- *Standardization Rules:* Maintain consistent casing and formats across text/date fields.  
- *Outlier Monitoring:* Apply thresholds for numeric columns to prevent unrealistic values.  
- *Documentation:* Continue recording queries, outputs, and cleaning steps for evaluator review.
